chats or other message areas or leave feedback for other users, we retain this information as
necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as
permitted by law. If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if
other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities on the Website, we
may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>
<p>b) Log Information: We log information about your use of our Website, including your browser
type and language, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the Website you visited

which your device is traveling, add location-based filters (such as local weather), and for
any other purposes.</p>
<p>e) Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We use various
technologies to collect information, and this may include sending cookies to you. A "cookie"
is a small data file transferred to your mobile that allows an Website to respond to you as an
individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor
its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes. Overall, cookies are safe, as they only identify
your mobile to customize your Web experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide us
access to your mobile or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the
information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor can they be used to
deliver a virus. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust
yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox or Google Chrome) to notify you of cookie
placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or decline cookies completely. If you turn off
cookies completely, there may be some Website features that will not be available to you,
and some Web pages may not display properly. To support the personalized features of our
Website (such as your country and language codes and browsing functions) we must send a
cookie to your computer’s hard drive and/or use cookie-based authentication to identify you
as a registered Website user. We do not, however, use so-called "surveillance" cookies that
track your activity elsewhere on the Web. We may also collect information using web
beacons (also known as "tracking pixels").</p>
<p>f) “Web beacons” or clear .gifs are small pieces of code placed on a Web page to monitor
behavior and collect data about the visitors using an Website. For example, Web beacons or
similar technology can be used to count the users who visit an Website or to deliver a cookie
to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use Web beacons or similar
technology on our Services from time to time for this and other purposes.</p>
<h4>3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION:</h4><br>
<p>I. We use the personal information we collect to fulfill your requests for services, improve our
services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and
external clients.</p>
<p>II. By providing us your mobile number, you consent to us using the mobile number to send
you our Website and services related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu
of communication by postal mail. You also agree that we may send notifications of activity
on our Website to the mobile number you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy
settings. We may use your mobile number to send you other messages, such as newsletters,
changes to our features, new services, events or other information. If you do not want to
receive optional messages, you may modify your settings to opt out.</p>
<p>III. Our settings may also allow you to adjust your communications preferences. If you do not
wish to receive promotional messages from us, you may opt out by following the
unsubscribe instructions in those messages. If you opt out, you will still receive nonpromotional

to) retain your information for archival purposes. We will not publicly disclose any of your
personally identifiable information other than as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

as “Personal Information Removal” at help@dofody.com.</p>
<p>VI. At our sole discretion, for any reason or no reason at all, we reserve the right to remove any
content or messages, if we believe that such action is necessary (a) to conform to the law,
comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce this policy, to take
precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party
claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security
or integrity of our Website; or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal
safety of the Website, our users, or others.</p>
<p>VII. Business Providers; Unaffiliated Businesses: At times, we may provide products, services
or offerings through our Services in cooperation with an unaffiliated third party. We may
share personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with any such
products, services or offerings with the unaffiliated third party (ies) involved in your
particular product, service or offering. For instance, when you express interest in products,
services, promotions, that we offer (for example, by completing a request for or information
regarding such services or completing an entry form for a promotion), we will share your
request or expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner to offer you
those products, services, promotions, and, as applicable, with their affiliates and third party
finder or marketing companies (collectively, “Business Providers”). By electing to
participate or otherwise expressing interest in any such product, service or offering
conducted in conjunction with any Business Provider, you expressly authorize us to provide
your personally identifiable information to those Business Providers. Please be aware the
Business Providers with whom we share your personally identifiable information may retain
or use your information whether or not you use their services, and the privacy and
information sharing practices of such Business Providers may differ from those described in
this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we may share personally identifiable information with
unaffiliated third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information. If you
prefer not to be contacted by any such Business Provider or other third party with whom we
share your personally identifiable information, you may follow the “unsubscribe”
instructions provided in any message you receive from any such third party.”.</p>
<p>VIII.Third Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform
functions on our behalf. Examples may include providing marketing assistance, providing
search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit/debit card
payments and providing customer service. In connection with their performance of functions
on our behalf, we may share personally identifiable information with such companies and
individuals as needed for them to perform their functions, but we do not permit such entities
and individuals to use personally identifiable information for other purposes. In addition, we
may provide non-personally-identifiable information to advertisers and other third parties
for their use in marketing efforts for us, themselves, or others. If you are not interested in
receiving targeted advertisements or other marketing information or materials as a result of
such efforts, you may adjust the settings on your mobile devices to prevent the use of your
non-personally-identifiable information in this manner.</p>
<p>IX. Third Party Promotions: We may send offers to selected groups of customers on behalf of
unaffiliated businesses that want to market their products or services to you, and as part of
these promotional offers we may sell or disclose certain of your personally identifiable
information to such unaffiliated businesses. If you prefer not to be contacted by any such
business with whom we share your personally identifiable information, you may follow the
“unsubscribe” instructions provided in any message you receive from any such third party.</p>
<p>X. In-House Promotions: We may on occasion combine information we receive through our
Services with outside records to enhance our ability to market our products and services that
may be of interest to you. If you have signed up to receive our messages and prefer not to
receive marketing information in connection with our Services, please follow the
“unsubscribe” instructions provided on any marketing message you receive in connection
with our Services.</p>
<p>XI. Business Transfers: As our businesses continue to evolve, we might sell one or more of our
companies, subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, personally identifiable
information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In such event, this Privacy
Policy may be amended as set forth below or the collection and uses of your personally
identifiable information may be governed by a different privacy policy.</p>
<p>XII. Protection of Our Services and Others: We reserve the right to release personally
identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties when we believe its release is
appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other
agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of Trader Interactive, our users or others.
This includes exchanging information with other unaffiliated third parties in connection with
fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>XIII.With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice and have the
opportunity to withhold consent when personally identifiable information about you might
be shared with unaffiliated third parties.</p>
<p>XIV.We may transmit the user data across the various Websites of the Company.</p>
<p>XV. User Submissions: If you participate in any online forum/communities, chat sessions and/or
blogs, or otherwise post in any user comment field visible to other users of our Services, any
information that you submit or post will be visible to and may be read, collected or used by
others who use our Services. We are not responsible for any information, including
personally identifiable information, you choose to submit in any such user comment field.</p>
<h4>4. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION:</h4><br>
<p>I. As a matter of policy, we will not sell or rent information about you and we will not disclose
information about you in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy except as required
by law or government regulation. We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as
other third parties, to enforce laws such as those regarding intellectual property rights, fraud
and other personal rights.</p>
<p>II. We will not share the personal information we collect about you with any third party for
their own marketing purposes without your consent. We may share your data with our
services providers who process your personal information to provide services to us or on our
behalf. We have contracts with our service providers that prohibit them from sharing the
information about you that they collect or that we provide to them with anyone else, or using
it for other purposes.</p>
<p>III. You may decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Services, in
which case we may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with
our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please discontinue use of our Service; your
continued usage of the Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy
Policy and Terms of Use.</p>
<p>IV. WE CAN (AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO) DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT
YOU TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, ANY
LAWSUIT OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY THAT WE, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION,
BELIEVE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE IN CONNECTION WITH AN
INVESTIGATION OF FRAUD, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, OR
OTHER ACTIVITY THAT IS ILLEGAL OR MAY EXPOSE US, OR YOU, TO
LIABILITY.</p>
<h4>5. ENSURING INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE</h4><br>
<p>I. We take reasonable precautions to ensure that the Personal Information we Collect, Use and
Disclose is complete, relevant and up-to-date. However, the accuracy of that information
depends to a large extent on the information you provide. That's why we recommend that
you:</p>
<p>a) Let us know if there are any errors in your Personal Information; and</p>
<p>b) Keep us up-to-date with changes to your Personal Information such as your name or
address.</p>
<h4>6. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION:</h4><br>
<p>I. We are very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable
information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to
protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>
<p>II. By using this Website or the Services or providing Personal Information to us, you agree
that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and
administrative issues relating to your use of this Website or Services.</p>
<p>III. We use commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve
the integrity and security of your Personal Information. Your sensitive information, such as
credit card/debit card information, is encrypted when it is transmitted to us. Our employees
are trained and required to safeguard your information. We cannot, however, ensure or
warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.
Using unsecured wi-fi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the
Service is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note
that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If we learn
of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you
can take appropriate protective steps.</p>
<p>IV. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your
information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or
legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical
issues; or to protect our rights or property. However, nothing in this Policy is intended to
limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a
government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
<p>V. However, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to
be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is not secure (for
example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been
compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in
accordance with the "Contacting Us" section available on our Website.</p>
<h4>7. SPECIAL CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL DATA</h4><br>
<p>I. Some of the data that you provide us will fall within what EU data protection law describes
as ‘special categories of personal data’, such as your racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs
or information concerning your health or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>II. We use this information in the same way we use all the other information we collect, but the
law requires that we have your explicit consent to collect and use it.</p>
<p>III. By accepting our updated Privacy Policy, you consent to Dofody using this information.</p>
<h4>8. LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4><br>
<p>I. Dofody is committed to the lawful, fair and transparent use of personal data. For every use
of your personal data we have described so far, we process your personal data on the
grounds that our processing is necessary for legitimate interests we pursue as a business,
namely that our business relies entirely on the ability to use your personal data to produce
research and insight for our clients.</p>
<p>II. If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or
would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds
apply, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the contact details in the ‘Contact
Us’ section.</p>
<h4>9. TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EEA</h4><br>
<p>I. We take all steps possible to ensure that your personal data remains within the European
Economic Area (“EEA”). However, in some cases we need to share data with other Dofody
group companies or third parties that are in countries outside the EEA, as described earlier.
These countries may not have similar data protection laws and so they may not protect the
use of your personal information to the same extent.</p>
<p>II. In these cases we put in place appropriate safeguards to make sure your personal data
remains adequately protected. Specifically, we make use of one of the following:</p>
<p>• Standard contractual clauses: We use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of
personal data to organizations outside the EEA. These contractual commitments have
been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection for personal
data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to
certain data protection standards including obliging them to apply appropriate technical
and security measures. We use standard contractual clauses when we transfer data to
other Dofody Group companies and for transfers to recipients that are neither Privacy
Shield certified nor located in a country covered by an adequacy decision.</p>
<p>• Adequacy decisions: Where the European Commission has determined that a country
outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to
that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above. Dofody
may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries
where such assurances have been given.</p>
<p>III. Please contact us using the details at the end of this notice for more information about the
protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents</p>
<h4>10. YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION:</h4><br>
<p>I. You have several choices regarding use of information on our Services:</p>
<p>II. Email Communications: We will periodically send you free newsletters and e- mails that
directly promote the use of our website, or Services. When you receive newsletters or
promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving
further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following
the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly.
Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related
communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>III. You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the
website, in which case, we will not be able to provide our services to you.</p>
<h4>11. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY:</h4><br>
<p>Our services are available only to persons who can form a legally binding contract under the Indian
